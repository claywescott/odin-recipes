        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until creamy and light, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in chocolate chips and nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until edges are golden brown but centers still appear slightly soft.</li>
            <li>Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Store cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
